So I just realized... I've been wearing my socks inside out for the past 3 months. Like, I've been intentionally putting them on backwards every single time.  I think I'm just trying to be different, ya know? Maybe it's a new fashion trend? I'm calling it "Anti-Sock"  ðŸ˜Ž  

Anyone else rocking the backwards socks?  Tell me I'm not alone. ðŸ˜©'''
